# Flip 'N' Answer

**Flip 'N' Answer** is a modern, interactive memory matching game with a twist: every time you match a pair, you must answer a JavaScript quiz question to earn points! This project is inspired by the "Memory matching game with score tracker and level up" idea from [Codecircuit's Idealist](https://www.codecircuit.ai/idealist).
